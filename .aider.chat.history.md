#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to generate the app logo.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
